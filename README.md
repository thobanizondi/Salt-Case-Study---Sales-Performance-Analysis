This dashboard is fully interactive, not just a static report.​

This interactivity enables quick day-level analysis without digging through raw data.​
This setup empowers business users to explore key performance insights with just a few clicks.

Key Interactive Features:

The role of the Slicer:​
When a user selects a date (e.g., Friday, October 14, 2022), it instantly updates all visuals — including KPIs, charts, and graphs — to reflect only the data from that selected day’s transactions. This makes the dashboard interactive, focused, and easier to analyze day-specific performance without navigating through raw tables.
